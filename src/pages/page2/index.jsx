        All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're
        best at, ain't it? Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can
        get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. You don't believe in the Force, do
        you?
        <strong> Oh God, my uncle.</strong>
        <em> How am I ever gonna explain this?</em>
        <span>I find your lack of faith disturbing. </span>

        Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The
        ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the
        Force.
      </h2>
      <p>
        You don't believe in the Force, do you? Escape is not his plan. I must
        face him, alone. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go
        home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. You're all clear, kid. Let's
        blow this thing and go home!

        <li>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.</li>

          I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the
          Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now.
          It's such a long way from here.
        </li>

        <li>
          No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly…

        I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding

          Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy
          mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by
          Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.

        The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip
        through your fingers. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see!
        How am I supposed to fight? Escape is not his plan. I must face him,
        alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… I
        care. So, what do you think of her, Han? I'm surprised you had the
        courage to take the responsibility yourself. Don't underestimate the
        Force.

      <p>
        In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. A tremor in the Force.
        The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. What good
        is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that
        battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find your lack of faith disturbing. Don't underestimate the Force. I
        suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self
        and act on instinct. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use
        it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage.
        It's more like…suicide.

        Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. But with the blast shield
        down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? Remember, a Jedi can
        feel the Force flowing through him. The Force is strong with this one. I
        have you now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. As you wish. But with the blast
        shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? Don't act so
        surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time.

        Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Your eyes can
        deceive you. Don't trust them. What!? Leave that to me. Send a distress
        signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.

      <p>
        You mean it controls your actions? You don't believe in the Force, do
        you? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. As you wish. Look, I can take you
        as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or
        wherever you're going.
      </p>
      <p>
        What!? Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Ye-ha! I
        want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I
        want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before
        me.
